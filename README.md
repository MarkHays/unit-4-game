This is project number 4 the crystal collector game made by Mark Hays.
this is a learning project of mine for uc berkeley bootcamp and i will continue to update it and maintain it. 
I added an animation to make the title div wobble when the page is loaded. 
this file can be found in the css/animate.css
users can help the project by maybe adding some more animations using this animate.css file
I will add more to this game as my learning progresses.
